## ✅ Benefits of Running Multiple Containers per EC2 Instance

1. Lower Cost:
   - Fewer EC2 instances → lower hourly charges.

   - You’re maximizing utilization of your server’s CPU and memory.

2. Faster Scaling Within an Instance:
   - Spinning up a new container is quicker than launching a new EC2 instance.

3. Simpler Networking at Small Scale:
   - Internal reverse proxies (like Caddy or Nginx) can handle routing without needing additional infrastructure.

4. Portability and Reusability:
   - Containers make deployments more consistent and reproducible.

## ⚠️ Downsides / Trade-Offs

1. Single Point of Failure:
   - If an EC2 instance fails, all containers on it go down.

   - With multiple EC2 instances, failure is more isolated.

2. Resource Contention:
   - Containers share CPU, memory, and disk I/O. If one container spikes (e.g., memory leak or CPU-bound task), it can degrade performance for others.

3. Complexity in Container Management:
   - You’ll need internal load balancing (Caddy in your case), proper logging, and health checks to ensure containers don’t step on each other.

4. Scaling Limitations:
   - You’re limited to how many containers you can fit in one EC2 instance. Eventually, you will need more instances.

5. Monitoring Granularity:
   - Monitoring multiple apps on one host can get messy unless you’re using tools like Prometheus, ECS, or Kubernetes.

6. Security Risks:
   - Misconfigured containers can impact other containers (since they share the same kernel).

   - EC2 instance compromise = all container compromise.

## 💡 So, Does It Outweigh Running More EC2 Instances?

| Situation                                                | Recommendation                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small/medium-scale app, cost-sensitive                   | ✅ **Use multiple containers per instance with internal load balancing** |
| High availability, production-critical, security-focused | 🔒 **Use more EC2 instances with 1-2 containers each**                   |
| Need autoscaling at fine granularity                     | ✅ **Container-based scaling is better (e.g., ECS, Kubernetes)**         |
| Expect large traffic spikes / low tolerance for downtime | 📈 **EC2-based isolation gives better fault tolerance**                  |
